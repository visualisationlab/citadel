# Visgraph

Git repo for visgraph, an application for rendering interactive networks.

## Description
Visgraph allows users to analyze and edit graphs through the web browser. It offers an API through which users can run code on the graph, by adding or removing nodes or edges, or changing attributes. Visual properties of nodes and edges are able to be mapped to their attributes. The tool is designed for explorative analysis of graphs.
