# Visgraph Client

The Visgraph allows the user to interface with the backend, startup new sessions, and edit graphs collaboratively.

## Design

The client runs using React. The user is automatically directed to the upload component, where they can upload a graph by passing a link.

This generates a session server-side with a unique URL, where the user is directed after they generate a session. 

The client communicates with the server via Websocket (located in the services directory). Client state is stored in a set of contexts (generated in the main component within the components directory). The context is updated using a set of reducers (located in the reducers directory). Reducers manage all state logic, and whenever a dispatch function (generated by the reducer) is called, the state is updated throughout all components that reference that state. For more information, visit https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html.

Server messages come in via the router component. Requests made to the server are run through the API service.
