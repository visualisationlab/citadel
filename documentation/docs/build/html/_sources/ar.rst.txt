Visgraph AR
###########

Visgraph AR is a tool for visualizing and analyzing networks in 3D using the
Hololens 2 headset developed by Microsoft. It is a research project developed
for a Bachelor's thesis and afterwards further expanded and improved under supervision
of dr. Rob Belleman at the UvA Visualisation Lab.

Setup
*****
The application needs access to the camera (for QR recognition) and networking capabilities.
Developers can load the application onto the Hololens 2 using Visual Studio. It is
designed to run independently from a PC and connects to an active Visgraph
session by scanning a QR code. The user generates the QR code by navigating to the
**Session Tab** in the Visgraph application and clicking the **Add Headset** button, and
afterwards, **Connect** to show the QR code.
